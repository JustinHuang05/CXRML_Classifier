CXRML Classifier is a prototype diagnostic tool designed to assist healthcare professionals in identifying pulmonary conditions like COVID-19 and pneumonia through advanced image analysis. Utilizing a DenseNet-121 Convolutional Neural Network, this application offers real-time analysis of chest X-rays with a high accuracy rate of 96.67%. Key features include a user-friendly interface, explainable AI that highlights significant image regions, and robust technology powered by PyTorch and guided backpropagation. The frontend of the website is hosted with Elastic Beanstalk (EBN) on Amazon Web Services (AWS) while the backend ML portion of the application is hosted with Cloud Run on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This architecture was chosen to gain familiarity with multiple cloud platforms.
